# PythonDiscordResearchBot

A python bot, that searches Wikipedia using the library "wikipedia" and sends the result.

Thank you for showing interest in this project. If you have any suggestion please suggest it in the pull requests.

If you want to use the BOT, add 2 files in where your python file is, the first named "TOKEN.txt" and the second named "server_languages.json". For the first one, add the discord token, but for the second one, set up the json file and it will work.

Any suggestion is appreciated.
